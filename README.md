# PR-Roundup #
This project was created to allow me to monitor the status of Pull-Requests and Peer-Reviews for various projects on Github.
To configure, in the file `constants.js`, add your pertinent info.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
